        <pre>
          <p style="color: aliceblue;">
          We clawed, we chained, our hearts in vain
          We jumped, never asking why
          We kissed, I fell under your spell
          A love no one could deny
        </p>
          Don't you ever say I just walked away
          I will always want you
          I can't live a lie, running for my life
          I will always want you
<p style="color: blue;">
          I came in like a wrecking ball
          I never hit so hard in love
          All I wanted was to break your walls
          All you ever did was wreck me
          Yeah, you, you wreck me
        </p>
          I put you high up in the sky
          And now, you're not coming down
          It slowly turned, you let me burn
<p style="color: purple;">
          And now, we're ashes on the ground
          Don't you ever say I just walked away
          I will always want you
          I can't live a lie, running for my life
          I will always want you
        </p>
          I came in like a wrecking ball
          I never hit so hard in love
          All I wanted was to break your walls
          All you ever did was wreck me
<p style="color: magenta;">
          I came in like a wrecking ball
          Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
          Left me crashing in a blazing fall
          All you ever did was wreck me
          Yeah, you, you wreck me
        </p>
          I never meant to start a war
          I just wanted you to let me in
          And instead of using force
          I guess I should've let you win
          I never meant to start a war
          I just wanted you to let me in
          I guess I should've let you win
<p style="color: indigo;" >
          Don't you ever say I just walked away
          I will always want you

          I came in like a wrecking ball
          I never hit so hard in love
          All I wanted was to break your walls
          All you ever did was wreck me
        </p>
          I came in like a wrecking ball
          Yeah, I just closed my eyes and swung
          Left me crashing in a blazing fall
          All you ever did was wreck me
          Yeah, you, you wreck me

          Yeah, you, you wreck me
